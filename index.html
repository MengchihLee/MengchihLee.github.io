        <h2> 1. Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail. </h2>
        <p>a) The first time I opened the site, I saw the visually deceiving background that attracted me. This web design makes me feel more like a blog.<br/>

          b) Then the text briefly introduced this falling sand type game.<br/>
        
          c) I followed the link to learn more about the origin of this game and what to play.<br/>
       
          d) I came into contact with this game, which is very special and different from the games I played. is a design game that simulates an ecosystem.<br/>
        
          e) I went back to the main page and noticed the photo content, I tried clicking the 'x' and found that more different photos popped up.<br/>
         
          f) I started to cut the content of the screen by 'x' until the content of the page became blank.<br/>

        <h2> 2. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </h2>
        <p><br/>
          <br/>
          The first thing I noticed was the background of the page and the name of the author of the game, because it was a visually deceptive background that made people notice it at once. </p>

        <h2> 3.What did you spend the most time engaging with? </h2>
        <p><br/>
          <br/>While browsing the entire page, the time I was most engaged was with the game. Because this is a relatively special game, it makes me feel very new.

        <h2> 4.What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience? </h2>
        <p><br/>
          <br/>What I use most often is to click on a link to learn more about the game.

        <h2> 5.What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? </h2>
        <p><br/>
          <br/>It can be seen from the design of the page and the name of the link on the page that it is a design type game. I can also learn by experiencing this game.

        <h2>6. How does the experience communicate it's primary goal? </h2>
        <p><br/>
          <br/>
			On this page, there are many links to the words in the profile. I can follow the link to get more information. The author did not put a lot of text on the page, but let users know little by little through links.

        <p><br/>
          <br/>The entire page, in addition to looking at the information to understand the content of this game. I also have an interactive experience through the design of the page. Pictures can be deleted to replace new photos, and the content can be deleted.

        <p><br/>
          <br/>When I open this page, the first thing I see is the background leading me to the author's name. This is a great way to let users know that this is the author who introduced the game. Emphasize the subject with concise and similar images. And let users know about the game little by little through links. A very easy way to achieve the effect of interacting with users<br/>

        <h2>9.What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it? </h2>
        <p><br/>
          <br/>When referring to the maxbittker website, I understand the layout of the entire page at a glance. The entire page is clean, so that users don't get bored by seeing a lot of text. Interact with users through links.

        <h2>10.What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you? </h2>
        <p><br/>
          <br/>The background of this website will cause visual fatigue to users after watching it for a long time, and the page does not have decorations about the game screen, which will appear too simple. If the user doesn't open the game link, they won't know what the game looks like.

        <h2> 11.What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?</h2>
        <p><br/>
          <br/>The most satisfying thing for me is that the author guides users to experience the game first and then read the information to have a deeper understanding of the game through the simplest way. The content and introduction are placed on separate pages to keep the site clean.
